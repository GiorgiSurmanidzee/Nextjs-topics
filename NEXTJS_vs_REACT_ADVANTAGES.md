# Advantages of Using Next.js Over React.js

This document outlines the key advantages of using **Next.js** compared to using **React.js** alone.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides additional features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing, enabling developers to build optimized, SEO-friendly, and scalable web applications with ease.

## Advantages of Next.js Over React.js

- **Better SEO Performance through Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
  - Pages are rendered on the server and sent fully formed to the client.
  - This improves search engine visibility and faster initial load times.

- **Built-in Routing with File-Based Routing**
  - Automatic route creation based on the `/pages` directory structure.
  - No need for manual routing setup like React Router.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
  - Generates static HTML pages at build time.
  - Enables extremely fast page loads and better scalability.

- **Automatic Code-Splitting**
  - Splits JavaScript code by page automatically.
  - Users download only the code necessary for the current page, improving performance.

## Additional Benefits

- **API Routes**
  - Build backend API endpoints inside the same project without setting up a separate server.

- **Image Optimization**
  - Built-in support for optimized, lazy-loaded, and responsive images.

- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**
  - Supports CSS Modules and Sass out of the box without extra configuration.

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Automatic prefetching, caching, and compression for faster load times.

## Summary

Next.js extends React by adding powerful features that simplify development and improve app performance and SEO, making it ideal for production-ready web applications.
